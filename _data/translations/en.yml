about:
  page_title: "About Tai Chi"
  page_subtitle: "Understanding the true martial nature of this ancient art"

  what_is_title: "What is Practical Tai Chi Chuan?"
  what_is_intro: "Tai Chi Chuan (Supreme Ultimate Fist) is a complete martial art system that has been refined over centuries. While many people know Tai Chi only as slow, meditative movements in parks, the art contains a sophisticated combat system designed for real-world self-defense situations."

  myth_title: "Common Misconception"
  myth_text: "Tai Chi is just slow exercise for relaxation and health"
  reality_title: "The Reality"
  reality_text: "Tai Chi is a complete fighting system with devastating combat applications"

  combat_apps_title: "Combat Applications"
  combat_apps_intro: "Every movement in Tai Chi forms contains multiple fighting applications. Here's what practical training reveals:"

  app1_title: "Joint Locks & Control"
  app1_text: "Subtle hand movements become devastating joint manipulations that can control or disable an opponent without striking."
  app2_title: "Hidden Strikes"
  app2_text: "What appears as gentle pushing contains concealed punches, elbow strikes, and pressure point attacks."
  app3_title: "Throws & Takedowns"
  app3_text: "Circular movements redirect opponent's force while setting up trips, sweeps, and projection techniques."
  app4_title: "Defensive Strategy"
  app4_text: "Footwork and body mechanics allow you to evade attacks while simultaneously counter-attacking."
  app5_title: "100g to overcome 1000kg"
  app5_text: "Use an attacker's force against them through leverage and timing principles."
  app6_title: "Psychological Warfare"
  app6_text: "Develop calm under pressure and learn to read and disrupt opponents' intentions."

  history_title: "Historical Context"
  history_battlefield_title: "From Battlefield to Park"
  history_battlefield_text: "Tai Chi was developed by Chinese martial artists who needed to defend themselves in life-or-death situations. The art evolved in a time when martial skills were essential for survival, not recreation."
  history_transformation_title: "The Transformation"
  history_transformation_text: "In the 20th century, as China modernized and the need for personal combat skills diminished, Tai Chi was increasingly promoted for its health benefits. While these benefits are real and valuable, the combat heritage was often de-emphasized or lost entirely."
  history_preservation_title: "Preserving the Complete Art"
  history_preservation_text: "Practical Tai Chi Chuan training seeks to preserve and teach the complete system - health, meditation, philosophy, AND combat effectiveness. We believe you cannot truly understand Tai Chi without understanding why each movement was created."
